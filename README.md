# startup-data-prediction
## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Startup_Profit_Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Run the notebook cells to train the model and make predictions.

## Model

The model used for this project is a Linear Regression model. The model is trained on the `50_Startups.csv` dataset and is used to predict the profit of startups.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. The R-squared score is a measure of how well the model fits the data, and the RMSE is a measure of the average error of the model's predictions.

## Results

The model achieved an R-squared score of [insert R-squared score here] and an RMSE of [insert RMSE here].
